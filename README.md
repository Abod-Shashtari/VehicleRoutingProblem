# Vehicle Routing Problem Using Simulated Annealing

This Project is and implmeatiation of **Simulated Annealing** algorithm to solve the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**. It optimizes routes for trucks from a base station to various delivery locations (nodes).

### How to Use  
  
1. **Set the Base Station:** Place the starting point (source of trucks).
2. **Add Nodes:** set the delivery locations (nodes), set their capacities, and position them on the map.
3. **Generate Random Routes:** Click **Random Path** to create initial random routes from the base station to nodes.
4. **Optimize Routes:**  
   - Specify the **Initial Temperature**.  
   - Press **Optimize** to run the algorithm and improve the routes.  
   - Run **Optimize** multiple times to refine the solution further.
